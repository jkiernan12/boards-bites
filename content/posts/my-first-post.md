We scooted across the street to the East Bay Bike Path. We headed south for a few miles to grab breakfast at Borealis.

## Details
+ **Distance**: 3.6 miles
+ **Date**: September 7, 2021

## Trip

We started from the apartment and scooted about a quarter mile to the path. There's plenty of parking spots along the bike path, though the closest to our entrance point would probably be the [Squantum Woods Park](https://goo.gl/maps/YWbBeDC4G1d3KzwBA). We had a pleasant cruise, except for the putrid stink of the sewage processing plant about a quarter mile from Borealis.
